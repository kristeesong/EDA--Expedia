### Project Description
* With a team of 7, created R script to clean, analyze, and present data findings on Expedia’s “booking success” outcomes within the US. 

* Represented factors contributing to successful outcomes in tabular format: time booked, mobile bookings, difference between timestamps (longevity of interest), travel destinations.

* Results showed that user longevity of interest did not result in successful bookings; mobile interfaces must be further implored.
